# First_Flask_prog
Simple flask program
This repository contains a simple Flask web application that demonstrates the basics of creating a web server and defining routes using Flask, a Python web framework.

app.py: This Python file is the core of the Flask application. It sets up the server, defines routes, and handles incoming requests. In this example, the main route ("/") returns a "Hello, Flask!" message when accessed.
